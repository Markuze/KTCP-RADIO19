\section{Introduction}
TCP split is a well known technique for optimizing link utilization with TCP flows. For the past 20 years, TCP split has been used for wireless networks, satellite transmissions, LAN and WAN optimizations ~\cite{chakravorty2003aggregation, le2015experiences,luglio2004,siracusano2016miniproxy,kernelsplit}. \AB{didn't check, but - were Dropbox and Akamai's SureRoute cited? }
Now as part of the the CBN project ~\cite{Elastic} we are introducing TCP split into a new context of public clouds as a networking infrastructure ~\cite{CDD}.
