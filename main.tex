\begin{abstract}
The \emph{Cloudified Business Network}(CBN) project~\cite{Elastic, CDD} constructs an \IK{a global?} overlay network across public clouds. CBN interconnects geographically-dispersed corporate datacenters and branches using \IK{rephrase end of sentence?} easily accessible public infrastructure \ie Azure,AWS,GCP,Alibaba Cloud, \etc 
Clients using CBN could see improvements in download times sometimes in the order of magnitude.\IK{by orders of magnitude?} The main ingredient in improving network performance was shown to be the split TCP technique~\cite{CDD, }. \newline
This paper describes \oursys, a Linux Kernel module written for CBN. When designing \oursys our goal was to create a reliable tool that could be safely used in an industry grade product. \IK{until now you haven't said what the problem is with existing products that you are trying to solve; need to spend a sentence killing them} \oursys is built with well trusted and tested "off-the-shelf" components. At the same time we were aiming to  minimize and effectively eliminate any overheads of establishing the split TCP connection. \IK{why? tell us why it's a problem today with existing products...} \oursys is built for CBN multitenant environment and designed to linearly scale on multi-core systems. \IK{Is this new? hard?} We show how \oursys is able to increase the network bandwidth and minimize the connection \emph{latency} close to the physically possible. \IK{you tell us that it achieves many things in hindsight, but haven't prepared us by telling us from the start why we care about them}
