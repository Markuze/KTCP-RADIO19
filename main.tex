\begin{abstract}
The \emph{Cloudified Business Network}(CBN) project~\cite{Elastic, CDD} constructs a global overlay network across public clouds. CBN interconnects geographically-dispersed corporate datacenters and branches. CBN leverages the global geographical spread of public clouds and their vast compute and networking infrastructure.
Clients using CBN could see improvements in download times sometimes by orders of magnitude. The main ingredient in improving network performance was shown to be the split TCP technique~\cite{CDD, }. 
%\IK{BTW you sell this as being about CBN only, but maybe you want to state that it's more general and could be used in a vast range of VMware products that could rely on TCP split, eg for VM migration?} 
Unfortunately, the available TCP split solutions incur a penalty on connection time, and actually hurt the performance of short flows. In addition, all available TCP split implementations are in user-space, and thus have two expensive system calls per forwarded segment. The redundant system calls hurt server performance and limit the scalability of such solutions.
\newline
This paper describes \oursys, a Linux Kernel module written for CBN. \IK{In the next sentences: 1. I suggest moving all sentences like ``our goal was..." to the first paragraph and merge into one of the sentences that state ``Current TCP split solutions also do not..." 2. I was missing 1-2 sentences about the algorithms/techniques/novelty in the result.} When designing \oursys our goal was to create a reliable tool that could be safely used in an industry grade product.  \oursys is built with well trusted and tested "off-the-shelf" components. At the same time we were aiming to  minimize and effectively eliminate any overheads of establishing the split TCP connection. \oursys is built for CBN multi-tenant environment and designed to linearly scale on multi-core systems. \IK{Is this new? hard?} We show how \oursys is able to increase the network bandwidth and minimize the connection \emph{latency} close to the physically possible. \IK{you tell us that it achieves many things in hindsight, but haven't prepared us by telling us from the start why we care about them}
